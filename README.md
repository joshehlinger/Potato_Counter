# Potato Counter
Because my wife loves her neopets and I can't stop myself.
It counts potatoes using selenium. Currently, you need to
actually be the one that clicks the 'submit' button. You
have 15 seconds to do so.

## Development
`virtualenv env`

`source env/bin/activate`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


Use latest version of chromedriver and python 3.7


## Usage
`python counter.py --username=MyName --password=Pass`
